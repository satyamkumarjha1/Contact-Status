# Contact-Status


Develop a basic Android application using Kotlin or Java that allows users to set a status message that is displayed when someone tries to contact them. This app will serve as a "Do Not Disturb" notifier with a personal message.

1. **Set Status**: Users should be able to enter a custom status message within the app.

2. **Display Status**: When the app is active and a call is received, display a toast/notification with the status message.

3. **Activate/Deactivate**: Provide a simple toggle to activate or deactivate the status message feature.


**Solution **
This is the app in which Android 10 version has been developed and java code has been used.

I have run it on Android version 13 if you want to run into lower version then you can do it.
I have also changed the version of its compile SDK and target SDK , So please change it before running.If you dont change then it will give error in the sync time 
on the app execution in the emulator or phone
